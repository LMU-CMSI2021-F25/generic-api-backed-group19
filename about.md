## About our Blackjack Webapp

---

We created a Blackjack app using an API that simulates a deck of cards. The API documentation can be found at: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
Our deployment link is: https://lmu-cmsi2021-f25.github.io/generic-api-backed-group19/

In our blackjack game, the player begins by selecting a unit with which to bet for the hand. 
This betting feature was created without using the API but we decided to add it to make the app feel more complete.

After the betting unit is selected, our app uses the API to shuffle the cards and create a dealer hand and a player hand.
The user is able to see both of their cards but the dealer's hand is hidden until the player makes a decision to hit or stay.
If the user presses the hit button, another card is added to their hand. If they press the stay button, the dealer hand is revealed and the game is over.
The winning and losing is the same as a normal blackjack game. If the user wins, they get the money that they bet, but if they lose the game, they lose their money.

If you know how to play blackjack, then you will have no trouble using our app.
