## AI REVIEW 
We used AI for debugging purposes, as well as to learn about a few design features.

- Logan Warner - I used AI for debugging and to understand the api functions in the code.

- Haley Hadiwidjojo - I used AI primarily for debugging and to help set up a checklist of what a blackjack game requires, ie. blackjack, 5 card charlie, busting, etc.
